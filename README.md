The NZ earthquake and ground motion database includes important earthquake data, such as hypocenter locations, corrected local magnitudes, and ground motion intensity measures. This database has been designed to be easily expanded. These pages will break down each catalogue that make up the database, and will outline procedures used to generate the catalogues.
