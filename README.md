# NZGMDB
This repository contains scripts used for the NZ earthquake and ground motion database (NZGMDB), which can be found here: https://osf.io/q9yrg/?view_only=05337ba1ebc744fc96b9924de633ca0e

The scripts are used for retrieving waveform data, preparing waveform data for quality classification, and processing of said data.

These scripts are very likely to break if you try to run them out-of-the-box. In particular, watch out for directory names, which are set to folders on my local machine and should be updated accordingly before running any scripts. 

Some day I will organize/document/rename scripts so that it all makes a bit more sense, but it is better for this to be available than for it all to disappear!
